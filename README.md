- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @arznlarzn
- 
- larsondavis.io
- This is my website/portfolio that will end up redirecting you to my project github repositories.
- You might even be here from my site. =P Thank you. =]

- Full transparency - Right now, my projects are kind of weak. I think I lost a bunch of code between computers,
- however, it simply means I need to redo projects or build some new ones. And I am trying to do this all in real-time.
- Every change, every commit, and every push-
- From the time I was 'okay' at coding
- Till I'm building my APIs and getting paid for it, or something like that.

- I am going to get into the field of technology.
- The difficult and uncommon, but possible and rewarding.
- And the biggest bragging points. Imo.

- Let's go!
