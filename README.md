- 👋 Hi, I’m @arznlarzn
- 👀 I’m interested in ... everything. I think I am going to focus on learning a low level language like C or Rust.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... I've actually been bouncing around. Right now though I am building a website wtih HTML, CSS, and JS that will serve as a place leading to my projects and my github repository that will be my portfolio.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Godot projects!?? Yaaaaaasssss!
- 📫 How to reach me ... discord @arznlarz
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I sing and song write. I learned how to code a couple years ago, and I've built projects in C#, lots of Python projects with GUIs, and I've dabbled with all kinds of stuff.
